# Online Grading System Project

*Dockerfile & Live Demo Coming Soon*

These files are for my Online Grading System Project. This project involves 3 people who make a front, middle, and back (I did parts of the middle & back) where a teacher can create and hand out a digital test and a student must take the test & be graded on it.

The project includes an autograder where the autograder will grade the system on:
* Compilation (it must compile successfully)
* Output (Teacher specifies an input & expected output)
* Function Name (Can detect if a user spells a function exactly as stated)
* Constraints (Can detect for contrains [e.g. student must use a for loop])

Teacher is also able to edit the individual scores & add comments.

## Requirements
* PHP 5.4.14+
* Python 3.7.0+
* MySQL
